title:  "Copying code the right way"
---

Sometimes the most pragmatic way to solve a problem is by copying code--forking a small subset of some other repo into your codebase.
Doing some Git&nbsp;Gymnasticsâ„¢ can help your future self when you inevitably need to take updates of the code you're copying.

## When to copy

When you can't avoid it.

## Features of a well-done copy

What do you, the future maintainer of some code, want to see when you encounter some code that was copied from another repo?

* You want to be able to **make local changes**, which is probably why you forked the code in the first place.
* You want to easily **attribute it to its source**, so you can see what's going on upstream. Maybe in the next release they solved your problem, so you can reference via package.
* You want to easily **update the local copy** when a relevant change happens upstream.
* You want the code to **play nicely in your repo**, fitting into your build system and not causing too many warnings or errors.

Some of these are in tension: if upstream uses tabs instead of spaces, or `snake_case` instead of `camelCase`, you probably _don't_ want to change every line; that would make updating hard. Likewise, if you're going to rewrite the whole thing, just do that, don't fork first.

## How to do it (summary)

```bash
git checkout --orphan code-from-WHEREVER
cp /the/origin/repo/path/to/file destination/in/your/repo
git add destination/in/your/repo
git commit -m "Code import from URL at $(pushd /the/origin/repo/ && git rev-parse HEAD)"
git checkout your-branch
git merge --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories code-from-WHEREVER
# integrate the code into your repo
git add . # stage all the changes as well as the merge
git commit
# optional: apply private changes
```

To update,

```bash
git checkout code-from-WHEREVER # or SHA of the orphan commit from before
                                # if you didn't push the branch
cp /the/origin/repo/path/to/file destination/in/your/repo
git add destination/in/your/repo
git commit -m "Code import from URL at $(pushd /the/origin/repo/ && git rev-parse HEAD)"
git checkout your-update-branch
git merge code-from-WHEREVER
# resolve merge conflicts
# build and test and fix any new bugs
```

## Detailed walkthough

## Recovering from past mistakes

If you have some copied code in your repo that _wasn't_ done this way, no proble You can do this retroactively, including getting all of the let-get-do-merges-for-you benefits from the update. It only costs one extra commit.
